# Sming project skeleton

This repository has all the bits to make start of any [Sming](https://github.com/SmingHub/Sming) based project on Linux. To use it with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) make sure you have both `ESP_HOME` and `SMING_HOME` environment variables set properly or VSCode C/C++ extension will not find included modules. After copying to your project environment uncomment relevant bits in `.gitignore` to make it tick.

* VS Code [C/C++ extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools) integration
* Intellisense with help of GNU Global tools provided by [C++ Intellisense](https://github.com/austin-----/code-gnu-global) and [RunOnSave](https://github.com/emeraldwalk/vscode-runonsave) extensions
* Build, clean and flash tasks already defined in VS Code workspace settings

## Licensing

Because of the "skeleton" nature of this project I explicitly **do not require** that you put any attribution either in source files of your project created out of the files that form this project, or any other textual documentation. You may license your project as you see fit as well.

The license terms still apply and if you decide to modify and distribute this skeleton while retaining its "skeleton" nature, you are required to follow MIT license requirements.
